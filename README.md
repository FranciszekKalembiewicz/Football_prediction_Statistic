# Football Season and Knockout Match Simulator using ELO Ratings

This project simulates a football league season and two-legged knockout ties using ELO ratings to predict match outcomes. It calculates expected and actual points for each team, simulates entire seasons, and performs probabilistic predictions of two-leg matchups (e.g. in a Champions League-style format). The simulation accounts for home advantage and probabilistic draws.

The league simulator allows for:

Full season simulation (each team plays others twice)

Calculation of expected points based on match outcome probabilities

Multiple season simulations to analyze average performance

Head-to-head two-leg match prediction with penalties when needed

Additionally, a short presentation (in English) explaining the project concept and approach is included — it's highly recommended to check it out if you're interested in how the probabilistic model was designed and calibrated!

Football has always been my passion, and I’m planning to expand this project and work on more football-related data science projects in the future.
